# Ozark-parity roadmap — "build a full dry cleaner from a blank slate"

**Goal (owner):** the builder at custompos.org must be able to produce a POS with the *full* feature depth of
the reference production dry cleaner (the origin app) — from a blank slate, using generalized tools (config +
a small set of toggle-able modules), with no trade-specific code hardcoded into a single business.

**Verified answer (from a two-sided audit, 2026-07):** *Yes, it can be done* — but it needs new **engine
primitives**, not just template data. The generalized engine already implements 9 of the 14 core primitives
(timers, 86/par, item routing, money math, deposits/A-R, status board + sanitized tracker, loyalty, profiles,
checklists). The `cleaner` template already builds a working single-store counter→detail→assembly→rack→pickup
POS. What's missing is the handful of mechanics that make a *real* plant-grade cleaner + delivery route.

This file is the execution checklist. Keep it current: check items off as they ship, in verified increments
(engine change → build the cleaner from blank → confirm the feature → commit).

> **Scope note.** "Build from blank" = the **downloaded single-file engine** produced by the builder. The
> optional **sync hub** (auth, public tracker portal, SMS/Twilio, card processing, photo store, rolling
> backups) and the **real card-payment module** are *separate infrastructure tracks* the owner deploys — they
> are intentionally not part of what the blank-slate builder emits. The reference `hub.js` is a minimal open
> sync server on purpose.

## Gap map (engine, not template data)

| # | Gap | What a full cleaner needs | Engine today |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Named lifecycle | `Received→Detailed→Assembled→Racked→Ready→PickedUp` from config, incl. public-tracker phrasing | hardcoded `INPROGRESS/READY/PAID/CLOSED` |
| 2 | Multi-store | `storeId` on records, per-station store scope, plant vs drop store, "assembled at <plant>" | no store field anywhere |
| 3 | Per-piece units | a durable per-garment tag (HSL), per-piece status/location/flags, per-garment history across visits | lines carry only a `qty` |
| 4 | In/out reconciliation | count-in vs count-out gate before an order can be marked ready | manual checkbox only |
| 5 | Detail-station entry | itemize/price/tag garments at the detail station | detail is a pass-through "mark done" |
| 6 | Assembly | bay assignment + smart bag splitting (spread thick items, comforters solo, bulk scan) | none |
| 7 | Print seam | garment tags, bag/rack labels, tickets, per-store colored-paper routing, print-agent hook | `window.print()` of a screen receipt |
| 8 | Delivery route | route / stop / driver / manifest / scan-to-rack, per-day scheduling | none (no sub-record system) |
| 9 | Roles + money-gate | refund/void manager-approval, a permission layer | no roles; refunds/voids ungated |

Smaller: multiple modifier groups + weight/scale items in the *builder* UI (engine already supports some);
open/close **recurring checklists** with photo/count/signature capture; per-customer/asset persistent flags.

## Build stages (each: engine primitive → builder toggle → verify from blank → commit)

- [ ] **Stage 1 — Foundation**
  - [x] 1a. Config-driven **named lifecycle stages** — SHIPPED. `FLOW.lifecycle` gives per-flow stage labels
        (`received`/`ready`/`done` + per-station `byStation`), with a `.public` override for the customer
        tracker. `stageOf(r,pub)` derives the order's stage from its least-advanced incomplete line and is
        used on the status board + sanitized tracker. Falls back to station labels when no config. Verified
        across all states, 0 console errors. (`pos.html`: `stageOf`, `renderBoard`, `renderTracker`; `cleaners` demo has a `lifecycle`.)
  - [x] 1b. **Multi-store** — SHIPPED. A flow with a `stores:[{id,name,plant?}]` list becomes multi-location
        (entirely inert without it). Each device is scoped to a store on the picker; every order is stamped
        with a `storeId` — the customer's home store if known, else the device's store, else the plant.
        Drop-store orders read "assembled at <plant>" on the board + the customer tracker; a store chip shows
        on the board / pipeline / checkout. Customers remember their home store (sticky). Print routing
        (Stage 4) will key off the order's `storeId`, never the workstation. Verified in-browser (0 console
        errors) + `tests/multistore.js`. (pos.html: `storesOn`/`homeStore`/`storeForOrder`/`storeChip`/`assembledAt`.)
  - [ ] 1c. Extensible **sub-records** on a record (child objects: pieces, route-stop) — the substrate Stages
        3/8 hang on.
- [x] **Stage 2 — Unique / serialized inventory + tag** (Gap 3) — SHIPPED (engine). Owner's reframe: HSL is just
      *unique inventory with stops before it sells.* An item marked `serialized` (+ `tagLabel`) becomes an
      individually-tracked UNIT — each is its own qty-1 line with a durable tag (HSL / serial / IMEI) that rides
      the item's stops. `tagChip` shows it on draft/board/pipeline/receipt; the tag is scan/editable at intake;
      `unitHistory(tag)` recalls returning units across visits. cleaners demo tags Shirt+Pants as HSL; fungible
      items (Wash & Fold) stay untagged. Verified, 0 console errors. (pos.html: `genUnitTag`/`tagChip`/`unitHistory`/`addLine`.)
      ↳ pending (folds into Stage 7): a "unique unit / tag" toggle in the builder's item editor.
- [ ] **Stage 3 — Detail entry + Assembly** (Gaps 4, 5, 6)
  - [ ] detail station can add/price/tag pieces (not just "mark done").
  - [x] assembly **smart bag split** + **in/out reconciliation** — SHIPPED. A production/staging station opts
        in via `station.bag = {max, solo:[cats], spread:[cats]}` (solo categories bag alone e.g. comforters;
        spread categories go ≤1 per bag to spread thick items; the rest fill to `max`) and/or
        `station.reconcile = true` (every piece must be counted out before the order can leave the station —
        count-in == count-out, a loss-prevention gate). Bag chips show on the pieces; the gate disables "Mark
        done" until reconciled. Verified in-browser (fill-to-max, comforters-solo, spread-thick, 0 errors) +
        `tests/assembly.js`. (pos.html: `bagLines`/`bagOrder`/`reconChecked` wired into `renderPipeline`.)
        ↳ (bulk scan — one scan reconciles a whole order — folds into Stage 4's scan/print seam.)
- [ ] **Stage 4 — Print seam** (Gap 7)
  - [ ] a `print()` seam with templates (garment tag, bag/rack label, ticket, receipt) + **route by the
        order's `storeId`** (kernel invariant) + a local print-agent hook (falls back to browser print).
- [ ] **Stage 5 — Delivery route module** (Gap 8)
  - [ ] route/stop/driver as config + sub-records; driver view, manifest, per-stop pickup/no-pickup,
        scan-to-rack, per-day scheduling; a "picked up a bag" → uncounted intake.
- [ ] **Stage 6 — Roles + money-gating** (Gap 9)
  - [ ] a permission layer (roles → allowed actions) + **request→approve** gate on refunds/voids/discounts.
- [ ] **Stage 7 — Expose + prove**
  - [ ] surface every new module/config in the **builder** UI (toggles + settings).
  - [ ] ship an **"Ozark-grade dry cleaner"** template that turns them all on.
  - [ ] **Validation:** from a blank slate, build a dry cleaner and confirm the full loop
        (intake → tag pieces → assemble w/ bags + reconciliation → rack → ready-text → route delivery →
        pickup w/ A-R) works end-to-end with 0 console errors.

## Kernel invariants (hold in every stage)
- Print routing follows the **order's** attributes (storeId), never the workstation.
- Card secrets live hub-side only; money-moving actions are gated.
- Every capability is **data-as-config** (an owner setting), not a code path per trade.
- Verify in the browser with **0 console errors** before checking a box.
